# Tic_Tac_Toe
 Java game UI

 >To try the game, you have to have BlueJ (a Java compiler) on your computer. 
 
 Clone this repo and run **package.bluej**


This is a simple tic-tac-toe game made with Java in BlueJ compiler to familiarize myself with the Java GUI module. 
1.	Initialize the game by creating a frame, 9 different buttons and menu and button panels in designated areas.
2.	Add action listeners to interact with all the units above. 
- 	Add available Toolkit library to make shortcuts (i.e CTRL-Q to quit game)
- 	Add events to button clicks to show X and O consecutively.
- 	Menu bar has a New Game option, Quit Game option and Night Mode option and can be interacted with shortcuts.
- 	Winner is decided when there is a column/ row/ diagonal combination and the result will be shown in a designated area of a GUI.
- 	Night mode was implemented to change the color of all the elements in GUI.
- 	A Zombie button was added and will play a .wav sound file when clicked.
