# Tic_Tac_Toe
 Java game UI

 To try the game, you have to have BlueJ (a Java compiler) on your computer. 

 Clone this file and run "package.bluej"

 This is a simple tic-tac-toe game made with Java in BlueJ compiler to familiarize myself with the Java GUI module. 

1.	Initialize the game by creating a frame, 9 different buttons and menu and button panels in designated areas.
2.	Add action listeners to interact with all the units above. 
a.	Add available Toolkit library to make shortcuts (i.e CTRL-Q to quit game)
b.	Add events to button clicks to show X and O consecutively.
c.	Menu bar has a New Game option, Quit Game option and Night Mode option and can be interacted with shortcuts.
d.	Winner is decided when there is a column/ row/ diagonal combination and the result will be shown in a designated area of a GUI.
e.	Night mode was implemented to change the color of all the elements in GUI.
f.	A Zombie button was added and will play a .wav sound file when clicked.
